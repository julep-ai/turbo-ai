The `tool_bot` function in this code is an asynchronous function that acts as a chatbot for handling user queries and providing responses using a set of tools. It is designed to work with the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model and takes a list of tools, an optional prologue, user type, instruction, example, and a maximum number of iterations as input parameters.

The function starts by yielding instructions to the user using the `TOOLBOT_TEMPLATE`. It then provides an example of how to use the chatbot using the `EXAMPLE_TEMPLATE` and the `default_tool_example` string.

The main part of the function is a loop that continuously listens for user input and processes it. It first gets the user input and then starts a tool agent to parse the input and determine if a tool is required to generate a response. If no tool is required, the loop continues to the next iteration.

If a tool is required, the function checks if the selected tool is valid by comparing it to the list of available tools. If the tool is not valid, it informs the user and continues to the next iteration. If the tool is valid, it runs the tool with the provided input and yields the result.

The loop continues until a final response is generated or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The final response is then sent to the user.

Here's an example of how the `tool_bot` function might be used in the larger project:

```python
tools = [GetInformation, Calculate, Translate]
prologue = "Welcome to Turbo Chat!"
user_type = "customer"
instruction = "Ask me anything, and I'll try to help you using my available tools."

await tool_bot(tools, prologue, user_type, instruction)
```

In this example, the chatbot is initialized with a set of tools (GetInformation, Calculate, Translate), a welcome message, a user type, and an instruction. The chatbot then listens for user input and processes it using the provided tools to generate responses.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `tool_bot` function and what are its inputs?
   **Answer:** The `tool_bot` function is an asynchronous function that takes a list of tools, an optional prologue, user_type, instruction, example, and max_iterations as inputs. It is designed to interact with the user, process their input, and use the provided tools to generate appropriate responses.

2. **Question:** How does the `tool_bot` function handle invalid tools?
   **Answer:** If the selected tool is not in the list of valid tool names, the `tool_bot` function yields a message to the user indicating that the selected tool is not valid and provides a list of valid tools to choose from.

3. **Question:** How does the `tool_bot` function determine when to stop iterating and provide a final response?
   **Answer:** The function keeps iterating until either the "final_response" key is found in the parsed_tools dictionary or the number of iterations left reaches 0. If a final response is found, it is sent to the user; otherwise, a default message is sent indicating that the function is not sure how to answer the question.
