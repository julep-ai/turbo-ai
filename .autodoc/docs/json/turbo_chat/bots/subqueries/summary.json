      "summary": "The code provided is a part of the `turbo-chat` project and serves as an entry point for importing the `subqueries_bot` functionality. This file is responsible for exposing the `subqueries_bot` object to other modules within the project, allowing them to utilize its features.\n\nThe first line, `# flake8: noqa`, is a directive for the Flake8 linter, which is a tool used to check Python code for adherence to coding standards and conventions. The `noqa` directive tells Flake8 to ignore any warnings or errors in this specific file, as they may not be relevant or necessary to address.\n\nNext, the code imports all objects from the `.bot` module using the wildcard import statement `from .bot import *`. This means that all objects defined in the `.bot` module will be available in the current module's namespace. The use of the dot before `bot` indicates that it is a relative import, meaning the `bot` module is located in the same package as the current file.\n\nAfter that, the `__all__` variable is defined as a list containing the string `\"subqueries_bot\"`. The `__all__` variable is a special variable in Python that defines the public interface of a module. When another module imports this one using a wildcard import (e.g., `from turbo_chat import *`), only the objects listed in the `__all__` variable will be imported. In this case, only the `subqueries_bot` object will be imported, ensuring that other objects from the `.bot` module remain private and are not unintentionally exposed.\n\nIn summary, this code serves as an entry point for the `turbo-chat` project to import and utilize the `subqueries_bot` functionality. It ensures that only the necessary objects are exposed to other modules, maintaining a clean and organized project structure.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `flake8: noqa` comment at the beginning of the code?\n   **Answer:** The `flake8: noqa` comment is used to tell the Flake8 linter to ignore this file when checking for style and syntax issues, as the developer might have intentionally written the code in a way that doesn't adhere to the standard style guide.\n\n2. **Question:** What does the `from .bot import *` statement do?\n   **Answer:** The `from .bot import *` statement imports all the objects (functions, classes, variables, etc.) defined in the `bot` module located in the same package as this file, making them available for use in this module.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `__all__` variable in this code?\n   **Answer:** The `__all__` variable is used to define the public interface of this module, specifying which objects should be imported when a client imports this module using a wildcard import (e.g., `from turbo_chat import *`). In this case, only the `subqueries_bot` object will be imported."

      "summary": "The `subqueries_bot` function in this code is designed to decompose a given request into a series of subqueries that can be used to query a knowledgebase. This is particularly useful in situations where a single question may require multiple pieces of information to be retrieved from the knowledgebase in order to provide a comprehensive answer.\n\nThe function takes several input parameters, including the main request, context, an example (defaulting to `default_subqueries_example`), maximum number of subqueries allowed (`max_queries`), request type, and the action to perform (e.g., \"answer\").\n\nFirst, the function yields a `User` object with a template and variables. The template, `SUBQUERIES_TEMPLATE`, is used to format the input parameters into a structured format that the model can understand. The variables include the request, context, example, maximum number of subqueries, request type, and action to perform.\n\nNext, the function generates an output using the `Generate` method with the `forward` parameter set to `False`. This output is then parsed using the `scratchpad.parse` method, which extracts the subqueries from the generated content.\n\nFinally, the function filters out any `None` values from the parsed subqueries and returns the list of subqueries as the result.\n\nHere's an example of how the `subqueries_bot` function might be used:\n\n```python\nrequest = \"What is the least expensive cereal that is healthy and has a low calorie content but is also tasty?\"\ncontext = \"User is a customer at a grocery store and is asking the question to the store manager.\"\n\nsubqueries = await subqueries_bot(request, context)\nprint(subqueries)\n```\n\nThis would output a list of subqueries like:\n\n```\n[\n    \"What are some tasty cereal that are healthy?\",\n    \"What are the prices of the above cereals?\",\n    \"What is the least expensive cereal of the above?\"\n]\n```\n\nThese subqueries can then be used to query the knowledgebase and gather the necessary information to answer the original request.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `default_subqueries_example` variable?\n   **Answer:** The `default_subqueries_example` variable provides a default example string that demonstrates how to use the `subqueries_bot` function. It is used as the default value for the `example` parameter in the function.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `subqueries_bot` function handle the input parameters and generate the subqueries?\n   **Answer:** The `subqueries_bot` function takes the input parameters (request, context, example, max_queries, request_type, and solve_act) and uses them to create a `User` object with the `SUBQUERIES_TEMPLATE`. It then generates output using the `Generate` function and parses the output using the `scratchpad.parse` function to obtain the subqueries.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `__all__` variable in the code?\n   **Answer:** The `__all__` variable is used to define the public interface of the module. It specifies which names should be imported when a client imports the module using a wildcard import (e.g., `from module import *`). In this case, it indicates that only the `subqueries_bot` function should be imported."

      "summary": "This code defines a data structure and a template for handling parsed queries in the `turbo-chat` project. The main purpose of this code is to provide a consistent way to store and manage multiple parsed queries, which can be used in various parts of the project.\n\nThe code starts by importing `Optional` and `TypedDict` from the `typing` module, and `Scratchpad` from the `structs` module in the project. The `__all__` list is defined to specify the public interface of this module, which includes `ParsedQueries` and `scratchpad`.\n\n`ParsedQueries` is a custom dictionary class that inherits from `TypedDict`. It defines a structure for storing up to 10 parsed queries, with each query being an optional string. This means that each query can either have a string value or be `None`. The keys for the queries are named `query1` through `query10`.\n\n```python\nclass ParsedQueries(TypedDict):\n    query1: Optional[str]\n    query2: Optional[str]\n    query3: Optional[str]\n    query4: Optional[str]\n    query5: Optional[str]\n    query6: Optional[str]\n    query7: Optional[str]\n    query8: Optional[str]\n    query9: Optional[str]\n    query10: Optional[str]\n```\n\nThe `scratchpad` variable is an instance of the `Scratchpad` class, which is parameterized with the `ParsedQueries` type. This means that the `scratchpad` object will store data in the format defined by the `ParsedQueries` class. The `scratchpad` object is initialized with a multiline string that serves as a template for displaying the parsed queries. The string contains placeholders for each query, enclosed in curly braces, which will be replaced with the actual query values when the `scratchpad` object is used.\n\n```python\nscratchpad: Scratchpad[ParsedQueries] = Scratchpad[ParsedQueries](\n    \"\"\"\n1. {query1}\n2. {query2}\n3. {query3}\n4. {query4}\n5. {query5}\n6. {query6}\n7. {query7}\n8. {query8}\n9. {query9}\n10. {query10}\n\"\"\".strip()\n)\n```\n\nIn the larger project, this code can be used to store and manage parsed queries from user input or other sources. The `ParsedQueries` structure ensures that the queries are stored in a consistent format, while the `scratchpad` object provides a convenient way to display and manipulate the queries.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ParsedQueries` class and why are all the attributes `Optional`?\n   **Answer:** The `ParsedQueries` class is a TypedDict that represents a dictionary with specific keys and types for its values. All the attributes are `Optional` because they may or may not have a value, allowing for flexibility in the number of queries being used.\n\n2. **Question:** How is the `scratchpad` variable being used and what is its purpose?\n   **Answer:** The `scratchpad` variable is an instance of the `Scratchpad` class, which is parameterized with the `ParsedQueries` TypedDict. It is used to store and manage the parsed queries in a structured format.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `__all__` variable in this code?\n   **Answer:** The `__all__` variable is used to define the public interface of this module. It specifies which names should be imported when a client imports this module using a wildcard import (e.g., `from module import *`). In this case, `ParsedQueries` and `scratchpad` are the names that will be imported."

      "summary": "This code defines a template for generating instructions to create a plan for collecting information to answer a complex question or solve a problem. The template is designed to be used in the larger turbo-chat project, where users interact with a knowledgebase that can provide answers to plain English queries.\n\nThe template, `SUBQUERIES_TEMPLATE`, is a multi-line string that uses Jinja2 syntax for variable substitution and control structures. It takes several optional parameters, such as `request_type`, `solve_act`, and `max_queries`, which have default values if not provided. The template guides the user through a step-by-step process to break down a complex request into individual, standalone queries that can be executed by the knowledgebase.\n\nThe instructions in the template are divided into two parts: \"Thoughts\" and \"Queries to execute\". In the \"Thoughts\" section, users are encouraged to think about the topic and required information for solving the request. In the \"Queries to execute\" section, users are instructed to write down a numbered list of concise, standalone queries, with a maximum limit of `max_queries` (default is 6).\n\nThe template also provides an example format for users to follow when writing down their thoughts and queries. The example is enclosed within \"START EXAMPLE\" and \"END EXAMPLE\" markers.\n\nHere's a sample usage of the template:\n\n```python\nfrom jinja2 import Template\n\ntemplate = Template(SUBQUERIES_TEMPLATE)\noutput = template.render(request_type=\"question\", solve_act=\"answer\", max_queries=5, context=\"A complex math problem\", request=\"Solve the equation x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0\")\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis would generate instructions for creating a plan to collect information for solving the given math problem, with a maximum of 5 queries to the knowledgebase.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `SUBQUERIES_TEMPLATE` variable in this code?\n\n   **Answer:** The `SUBQUERIES_TEMPLATE` variable holds a template string that is used to generate instructions for creating a plan to collect information for answering a complex question. It includes placeholders for various parameters and a specific format for writing down thoughts and queries.\n\n2. **Question:** What are the default values for `_request_type`, `_solve_act`, and `_max_queries` in the template?\n\n   **Answer:** The default values for `_request_type`, `_solve_act`, and `_max_queries` are \"question\", \"answer\", and 6, respectively.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the template handle inflection for the `_solve_act` variable?\n\n   **Answer:** The template uses the `inflect(\"VBG\")` filter to convert the `_solve_act` variable into its gerund form (e.g., \"answering\" for the default value \"answer\")."
