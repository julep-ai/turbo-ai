  "summary": "This code defines a data structure and a template for handling tools in the Turbo-Chat project. The main purpose of this code is to manage the parsed information related to tools, such as their names, inputs, and responses, in a structured and organized manner.\n\nThe code starts by importing `Optional` and `TypedDict` from the `typing` module, and `Scratchpad` from the `structs` module in the project. It then defines the `__all__` variable, which is a list containing the names of the public objects that should be imported when the module is imported using a wildcard (e.g., `from module import *`).\n\nThe `ParsedTools` class is a `TypedDict`, which is a dictionary with a fixed set of keys and their corresponding value types. This class has four keys: `should_use_tool`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, and `final_response`. Each key has an `Optional` value type, meaning that the value can be either of the specified type or `None`. This allows for flexibility in handling cases where some information might not be available.\n\nThe `scratchpad` variable is an instance of the `Scratchpad` class, which is a generic class for handling templates. In this case, the `Scratchpad` class is instantiated with the `ParsedTools` type, meaning that it will handle templates related to the `ParsedTools` data structure. The template string provided to the `Scratchpad` instance is a multi-line string containing placeholders for the `tool_name`, `tool_input`, and `final_response` fields. The `.strip()` method is called on the string to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nIn the larger Turbo-Chat project, this code can be used to manage and format the information related to tools. For example, when a tool is used in the chat, the parsed information can be stored in a `ParsedTools` instance, and the `scratchpad` can be used to generate a formatted output for displaying the tool's information in the chat.\n\nHere's an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```python\nparsed_tools = ParsedTools(\n    should_use_tool=True,\n    tool_name=\"Example Tool\",\n    tool_input=\"Sample Input\",\n    final_response=\"Sample Output\"\n)\n\nformatted_output = scratchpad.format(parsed_tools)\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nTool: Example Tool\nTool Input: Sample Input\nResponse: Sample Output\n```",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ParsedTools` class and what are its attributes?\n   **Answer:** The `ParsedTools` class is a TypedDict that represents the structure of parsed tools data. It has four attributes: `should_use_tool`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, and `final_response`, all of which are optional.\n\n2. **Question:** How is the `scratchpad` variable being used and what is its purpose?\n   **Answer:** The `scratchpad` variable is an instance of the `Scratchpad` class with the type `ParsedTools`. It is used to store and manage the parsed tools data in a structured format, using a template string to define the layout.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `__all__` variable in this code?\n   **Answer:** The `__all__` variable is a list that defines the public interface of this module. It specifies which names should be imported when a client imports this module using a wildcard import (e.g., `from module import *`). In this case, `ParsedTools` and `scratchpad` are the names that will be imported."
