The `turbo_chat/cache` package provides a simple in-memory caching mechanism for the Turbo-Chat project. It consists of two files: `__init__.py` and `simple.py`.

`__init__.py` is responsible for importing and exposing the `SimpleCache` class from the `simple` module. It uses a wildcard import to achieve this, and the `__all__` variable is defined to ensure that only the `SimpleCache` class is exposed to the users of this module. This allows for a clean and simple interface to access the caching functionality provided by the `SimpleCache` class.

`simple.py` contains the `SimpleCache` class, which inherits from both `BaseCache` and `pydantic.BaseModel`. This means it utilizes the functionality provided by these two classes, such as data validation and serialization. The `SimpleCache` class has a `cache` attribute, which is a dictionary that stores the cached data, and four asynchronous methods: `has`, `set`, `get`, and `clear`.

Here's an example of how the `SimpleCache` class can be used in the larger project:

```python
from turbo_chat import SimpleCache

cache = SimpleCache()

# Store a key-value pair in the cache
await cache.set("key1", "value1")

# Check if a key exists in the cache
print(await cache.has("key1"))  # Output: True

# Retrieve the value associated with a key from the cache
print(await cache.get("key1"))  # Output: "value1"

# Clear the cache
await cache.clear()
print(await cache.has("key1"))  # Output: False
```

In the larger project, the `SimpleCache` class can be used to store and retrieve data that needs to be accessed frequently, reducing the need for expensive operations like database queries or API calls.
