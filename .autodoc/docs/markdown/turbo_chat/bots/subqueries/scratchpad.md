This code defines a data structure and a template for handling parsed queries in the `turbo-chat` project. The main purpose of this code is to provide a consistent way to store and manage multiple parsed queries, which can be used in various parts of the project.

The code starts by importing `Optional` and `TypedDict` from the `typing` module, and `Scratchpad` from the `structs` module in the project. The `__all__` list is defined to specify the public interface of this module, which includes `ParsedQueries` and `scratchpad`.

`ParsedQueries` is a custom dictionary class that inherits from `TypedDict`. It defines a structure for storing up to 10 parsed queries, with each query being an optional string. This means that each query can either have a string value or be `None`. The keys for the queries are named `query1` through `query10`.

```python
class ParsedQueries(TypedDict):
    query1: Optional[str]
    query2: Optional[str]
    query3: Optional[str]
    query4: Optional[str]
    query5: Optional[str]
    query6: Optional[str]
    query7: Optional[str]
    query8: Optional[str]
    query9: Optional[str]
    query10: Optional[str]
```

The `scratchpad` variable is an instance of the `Scratchpad` class, which is parameterized with the `ParsedQueries` type. This means that the `scratchpad` object will store data in the format defined by the `ParsedQueries` class. The `scratchpad` object is initialized with a multiline string that serves as a template for displaying the parsed queries. The string contains placeholders for each query, enclosed in curly braces, which will be replaced with the actual query values when the `scratchpad` object is used.

```python
scratchpad: Scratchpad[ParsedQueries] = Scratchpad[ParsedQueries](
    """
1. {query1}
2. {query2}
3. {query3}
4. {query4}
5. {query5}
6. {query6}
7. {query7}
8. {query8}
9. {query9}
10. {query10}
""".strip()
)
```

In the larger project, this code can be used to store and manage parsed queries from user input or other sources. The `ParsedQueries` structure ensures that the queries are stored in a consistent format, while the `scratchpad` object provides a convenient way to display and manipulate the queries.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ParsedQueries` class and why are all the attributes `Optional`?
   **Answer:** The `ParsedQueries` class is a TypedDict that represents a dictionary with specific keys and types for its values. All the attributes are `Optional` because they may or may not have a value, allowing for flexibility in the number of queries being used.

2. **Question:** How is the `scratchpad` variable being used and what is its purpose?
   **Answer:** The `scratchpad` variable is an instance of the `Scratchpad` class, which is parameterized with the `ParsedQueries` TypedDict. It is used to store and manage the parsed queries in a structured format.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `__all__` variable in this code?
   **Answer:** The `__all__` variable is used to define the public interface of this module. It specifies which names should be imported when a client imports this module using a wildcard import (e.g., `from module import *`). In this case, `ParsedQueries` and `scratchpad` are the names that will be imported.
