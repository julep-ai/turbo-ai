The `turbo-chat` project contains a file that defines a function called `summarize_bot`. This function is designed to generate a summary of a given text using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The purpose of this code is to provide a high-level interface for summarizing text within the larger project.

The `summarize_bot` function takes two arguments: `text` and `text_type`. The `text` argument is the input text that needs to be summarized, while the `text_type` argument is an optional parameter that describes the type of text being summarized (e.g., "article", "email", etc.). By default, `text_type` is set to "text".

The function uses a template called `SUMMARIZE_TEMPLATE` to format the input for the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. This template is a string that includes placeholders for the `text_type` and `text` variables. When the function is called, these placeholders are replaced with the actual values provided by the user.

The `summarize_bot` function is defined as an asynchronous function using the `async def` syntax. This means that it can be used with Python's `asyncio` library for concurrent execution, which is useful when working with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, as it allows for efficient handling of multiple requests.

The function is decorated with the `@turbo` decorator, which indicates that it should use the GPT-3.5 Turbo model for generating the summary. The `temperature` parameter is set to 0.2, which controls the randomness of the generated text. Lower values make the output more focused and deterministic, while higher values make it more random.

Here's an example of how the `summarize_bot` function might be used in the larger project:

```python
import asyncio
from turbo_chat import summarize_bot

async def main():
    text = "This is a sample text that needs to be summarized."
    summary = await summarize_bot(text, text_type="text")
    print(summary)

asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, the `main` function is defined as asynchronous and calls the `summarize_bot` function with a sample text. The summary is then printed to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `summarize_bot` function?
   **Answer:** The `summarize_bot` function is an asynchronous function that takes a given text and its type as input, and generates a summary using the GPT-3.5-turbo model with a temperature of 0.2.

2. **Question:** How is the `SUMMARIZE_TEMPLATE` used in the `summarize_bot` function?
   **Answer:** The `SUMMARIZE_TEMPLATE` is a string template that formats the input text and text_type into a prompt for the GPT-3.5-turbo model. It is used in the `summarize_bot` function to create a `User` object with the formatted prompt.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `__all__` variable in the code?
   **Answer:** The `__all__` variable is a list that defines the public interface of the module. It specifies which names should be imported when a client imports the module using a wildcard import (e.g., `from module import *`). In this case, only the `summarize_bot` function is included in the public interface.
