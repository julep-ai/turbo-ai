      "summary": "The code provided is part of the `turbo-chat` project and serves as an entry point for importing the `tool_bot` functionality. The main purpose of this code is to make it easy for other modules within the project to access and use the `tool_bot` class and its associated methods.\n\nAt the beginning of the code, there is a comment `# flake8: noqa`. This is a directive for the Flake8 linter, a popular Python code analysis tool, to ignore this file when checking for coding style violations. This is likely because the file is simple and doesn't require strict adherence to coding standards.\n\nNext, the code imports everything from the `.bot` module using a relative import statement: `from .bot import *`. This means that all classes, functions, and variables defined in the `.bot` module will be available in the current module's namespace. The use of the wildcard `*` in the import statement is generally discouraged in Python, as it can lead to name clashes and make it difficult to determine which names are actually being imported. However, in this case, it is acceptable because the purpose of this file is to provide a single entry point for importing the `tool_bot` functionality.\n\nFinally, the code defines a list called `__all__` containing the string `\"tool_bot\"`. The `__all__` variable is a special variable in Python that defines the public interface of a module. When another module imports this one using a wildcard import (e.g., `from turbo_chat import *`), only the names listed in `__all__` will be imported. In this case, the `tool_bot` class will be the only name imported, ensuring that other modules can easily access and use it without importing any unnecessary names.\n\nIn summary, this code serves as an entry point for the `tool_bot` functionality in the `turbo-chat` project, making it easy for other modules to access and use the `tool_bot` class and its associated methods. The use of the `__all__` variable ensures that only the necessary names are imported when using wildcard imports.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `flake8: noqa` comment at the beginning of the file?\n   **Answer:** The `flake8: noqa` comment is used to tell the Flake8 linter to ignore this file when checking for code style violations, allowing the developer to bypass any style-related warnings or errors for this specific file.\n\n2. **Question:** What does the `from .bot import *` statement do?\n   **Answer:** The `from .bot import *` statement imports all the objects (functions, classes, variables, etc.) from the `bot` module located in the same package as this file, making them available for use in this module.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `__all__` variable in this file?\n   **Answer:** The `__all__` variable is used to define the public interface of this module, specifying which objects should be imported when a client imports this module using a wildcard import (e.g., `from turbo_chat import *`). In this case, only the `tool_bot` object will be imported."

      "summary": "The `tool_bot` function in this code is an asynchronous function that acts as a chatbot for handling user queries and providing responses using a set of tools. It is designed to work with the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model and takes a list of tools, an optional prologue, user type, instruction, example, and a maximum number of iterations as input parameters.\n\nThe function starts by yielding instructions to the user using the `TOOLBOT_TEMPLATE`. It then provides an example of how to use the chatbot using the `EXAMPLE_TEMPLATE` and the `default_tool_example` string.\n\nThe main part of the function is a loop that continuously listens for user input and processes it. It first gets the user input and then starts a tool agent to parse the input and determine if a tool is required to generate a response. If no tool is required, the loop continues to the next iteration.\n\nIf a tool is required, the function checks if the selected tool is valid by comparing it to the list of available tools. If the tool is not valid, it informs the user and continues to the next iteration. If the tool is valid, it runs the tool with the provided input and yields the result.\n\nThe loop continues until a final response is generated or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The final response is then sent to the user.\n\nHere's an example of how the `tool_bot` function might be used in the larger project:\n\n```python\ntools = [GetInformation, Calculate, Translate]\nprologue = \"Welcome to Turbo Chat!\"\nuser_type = \"customer\"\ninstruction = \"Ask me anything, and I'll try to help you using my available tools.\"\n\nawait tool_bot(tools, prologue, user_type, instruction)\n```\n\nIn this example, the chatbot is initialized with a set of tools (GetInformation, Calculate, Translate), a welcome message, a user type, and an instruction. The chatbot then listens for user input and processes it using the provided tools to generate responses.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `tool_bot` function and what are its inputs?\n   **Answer:** The `tool_bot` function is an asynchronous function that takes a list of tools, an optional prologue, user_type, instruction, example, and max_iterations as inputs. It is designed to interact with the user, process their input, and use the provided tools to generate appropriate responses.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `tool_bot` function handle invalid tools?\n   **Answer:** If the selected tool is not in the list of valid tool names, the `tool_bot` function yields a message to the user indicating that the selected tool is not valid and provides a list of valid tools to choose from.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the `tool_bot` function determine when to stop iterating and provide a final response?\n   **Answer:** The function keeps iterating until either the \"final_response\" key is found in the parsed_tools dictionary or the number of iterations left reaches 0. If a final response is found, it is sent to the user; otherwise, a default message is sent indicating that the function is not sure how to answer the question."

      "summary": "This code defines a data structure and a template for handling tools in the Turbo-Chat project. The main purpose of this code is to manage the parsed information related to tools, such as their names, inputs, and responses, in a structured and organized manner.\n\nThe code starts by importing `Optional` and `TypedDict` from the `typing` module, and `Scratchpad` from the `structs` module in the project. It then defines the `__all__` variable, which is a list containing the names of the public objects that should be imported when the module is imported using a wildcard (e.g., `from module import *`).\n\nThe `ParsedTools` class is a `TypedDict`, which is a dictionary with a fixed set of keys and their corresponding value types. This class has four keys: `should_use_tool`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, and `final_response`. Each key has an `Optional` value type, meaning that the value can be either of the specified type or `None`. This allows for flexibility in handling cases where some information might not be available.\n\nThe `scratchpad` variable is an instance of the `Scratchpad` class, which is a generic class for handling templates. In this case, the `Scratchpad` class is instantiated with the `ParsedTools` type, meaning that it will handle templates related to the `ParsedTools` data structure. The template string provided to the `Scratchpad` instance is a multi-line string containing placeholders for the `tool_name`, `tool_input`, and `final_response` fields. The `.strip()` method is called on the string to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.\n\nIn the larger Turbo-Chat project, this code can be used to manage and format the information related to tools. For example, when a tool is used in the chat, the parsed information can be stored in a `ParsedTools` instance, and the `scratchpad` can be used to generate a formatted output for displaying the tool's information in the chat.\n\nHere's an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```python\nparsed_tools = ParsedTools(\n    should_use_tool=True,\n    tool_name=\"Example Tool\",\n    tool_input=\"Sample Input\",\n    final_response=\"Sample Output\"\n)\n\nformatted_output = scratchpad.format(parsed_tools)\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nTool: Example Tool\nTool Input: Sample Input\nResponse: Sample Output\n```",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ParsedTools` class and what are its attributes?\n   **Answer:** The `ParsedTools` class is a TypedDict that represents the structure of parsed tools data.

      "summary": "This code defines a template for a chatbot conversation in the Turbo-Chat project. The chatbot acts as a facilitator between the user and an expert, relaying messages between them and providing the expert with a set of tools to assist the user.\n\nThe `TOOLBOT_TEMPLATE` is a Jinja2 template that generates a formatted conversation script. It includes optional prologue and additional information sections, instructions for the expert, and a list of available tools. The template also specifies the format for user messages, expert responses, and tool usage.\n\nThe conversation starts with the chatbot introducing the user type and providing instructions to the expert. The expert's responses should be in the format `Response: <what you want to say>`. The chatbot will relay these responses to the user.\n\nThe expert has access to a set of tools, which are listed in the template. To use a tool, the expert must reply in the following format:\n\n```\n{{user_type | capitalize}} said: <what the {{user_type}} said>\nThought: Need to use a tool? <Yes or No>\nTool: <the name of the tool to use>\nTool Input: <the input to the tool in the format specified by the tool>\n```\n\nThe chatbot will then provide the result of the tool in the format `Tool Result: <the result of the tool you used>`.\n\nThe `EXAMPLE_TEMPLATE` is another Jinja2 template that wraps an example conversation between the expert and the user.

They are used to structure the conversation and provide instructions on how to interact with the toolbot and use the available tools.\n\n2. **Question:** How are the tools and their documentation added to the `Tools` section in the `TOOLBOT_TEMPLATE`?\n   **Answer:** The tools are added to the `Tools` section using a for loop `{% for tool in tools %}` that iterates through the `tools` list. For each tool, the tool's name (`{{tool.__name__}}`) and documentation (`{{tool.__doc__}}`) are added to the template.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the code handle the case when there is additional information to be provided in the `TOOLBOT_TEMPLATE`?\n   **Answer:** The code checks if the `additional_info` variable is present using `{% if additional_info -%}`. If it is present, the additional information is added to the template using `{{additional_info}}`."
